# Attractors With Dynamic Parameters

A Processing sketch for rendering and interacting with a few attractors using dynamically-generated parameters

Parameters a, b, c, and d are made higher/lower using w/s, d/a, up/down, and right/left keys.
Some parameters are determined by a walk through perlin noise and are not alterable.

Currently still experimenting with appropriate parameter ranges

Depends on ControlP5, the GUI library for Processing (http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/)
